# Zadeh-s-General-Type-2-Fuzzy-Logic-Systems-for-Uncertainty-Quantification

Matlab implementation of the following paper:

```
Y. Guven, A. Koklu, T. Kumbasar, 2024. Exploring Zadeh's General Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems for Uncertainty Quantification, IEEE TFS.
```
We kindly ask that to cite the above mentioned paper if you use GT2-FLSs functions and you publish papers about work that was performed using these codes.

Before utilizing the code, ensure that the corresponding "lib" files for both General Type-2 fuzzy logic systems GT2-FLSs are added to your MATLAB path. Additionally, please ensure that you correctly adjust the paths for the datasets according to your directory structure.

This repository will be updated to include any new methods published in the future.
